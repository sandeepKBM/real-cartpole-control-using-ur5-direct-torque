"""Box QP extended with a small number of general linear inequality
constraints, via dual ascent on scalar Lagrange multipliers -- reusing
box_qp.solve_box_qp as the inner solver rather than writing a new active-set
QP solver from scratch.

Problem: min 0.5 x'Hx + f'x  s.t. lo <= x <= hi,  A_ineq @ x <= b_ineq

For a FIXED set of multipliers lambda >= 0 (one per linear constraint),
minimizing the Lagrangian 0.5x'Hx + f'x + lambda' @ (A_ineq @ x - b_ineq)
over the box alone is exactly solve_box_qp(H, f + A_ineq.T @ lambda, lo, hi)
-- the SAME already-tested box solver, just with a shifted linear term.

For each constraint i, g_i(lambda_i) = (A_ineq @ x(lambda))[i] - b_ineq[i]
is a continuous, monotonically non-increasing function of lambda_i (holding
the other multipliers fixed) for lambda_i >= 0 -- increasing lambda_i pushes
x harder away from violating constraint i. Complementary slackness requires
either lambda_i = 0 (constraint inactive, g_i(0) <= 0 already) or
g_i(lambda_i) = 0 (constraint active, tight). This is a classic dual
coordinate-ascent structure: root-find each lambda_i (bisection + secant,
not a fixed large iteration count -- see solve_constrained_box_qp's own
iteration budget reasoning) with the other multipliers held fixed, sweep
over constraints a bounded number of times.

Deliberately scoped to a SMALL number of constraints (real-time budget: each
root-find iteration is one solve_box_qp call, ~0.3-1ms measured on this
hardware -- see docs/status or the 2026-08-03 session notes for the actual
timing numbers this scoping is based on). Not a general-purpose QP solver.
